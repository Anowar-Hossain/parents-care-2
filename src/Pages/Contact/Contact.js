                <h3>There are many reasons to use Parents Care.com</h3>
                <p><small>Parents Care.com provides immediate access to board certified primary care physicians for patients suffering from common and easily diagnosable and treatable medical problems. Many times, these patients would otherwise end up in ER or urgent care centers.
                The cost of a visit to the ER or Urgent Care Center can be anywhere between $300-$500. The cost of a WebDoctors.com visit starts at $39.95 for most conditions. Click here to view our fee schedule.
                Many patients with relatively minor ailments will typically visit an emergency room, which causes overcrowding. The result adds to the increasing cost of health care, and diverts attention of ER staff away from more critical patients.
                Many times, treatment of minor ailments – if not treated quickly – can turn into more complicated problems. Bronchitis, for example, if not treated promptly may turn into pneumonia.
                There are no subscriptions, and no insurance necessary.</small></p>
