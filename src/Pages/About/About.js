            <h1>Why an Online Doctor vs. Office Visit</h1>
            <p><small>Unfortunately, sickness does not give us advanced notice. You wake up in the morning feeling unwell. Often times, you know what you have, and what you need. For many of us, the thought of going to the doctor is enough to minimize the pain and symptoms that we are truly experiencing. It’s easy to put off treatment that you genuinely need in the hopes of the symptoms going away eventually, only for them to get worse over time. From finding a doctor to scheduling an appointment to making arrangements to step away from work, the entire process can be extremely stressful, especially when all you want is to feel better as soon as possible. Plus, in many scenarios, you end up spending more time in the waiting room surrounded by others who are sick rather than getting the treatment and attention that you need.

            On average, there are 900 million in-person doctor visits in the United States every year, and roughly 50 percent of these can be completed remotely. In those completed appointments, the average time that a doctor spends with a patient is only 7 minutes. If you visit the emergency room, the average wait time is 90 minutes. If you visit an urgent care center, the average wait time is 60 minutes. Even the average wait time in a physician’s office is 30 minutes. Most people do not have this much time to dedicate to visiting a doctor that will spend minimal time with them, nor do they want to venture out in public when they are feeling so unlike themselves.

            Now factor in all of the time spent scheduling a doctor’s appointment, driving to the doctor’s office, spending time in the waiting room, briefly seeing the doctor, and finally driving home. It’s no wonder people don’t want to mess with this process and instead opt to tough it out without the treatment that they need.
